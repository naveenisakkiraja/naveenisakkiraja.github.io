Compute the properties of the standard atmosphere at a specified altitude using 1976 Standard Atmosphere Model.
The user may choose between SI and US Custom units.

The equations and parameters used are documented in a book entitled U.S. Standard Atmospere, 1976 published by the U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.
The equations defining the 1976 Standard Atmosphere Model upto 86 km (282,000 ft.) from sea level that accepts altitude as an input argument and returns non-dimensional values of temperature, pressure, density,etc. and it has been back-tested and validated against the NASA-TM-X-74335 report.
